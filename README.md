# Introduction
ShinyCell is an extremely usefull R package generated by [Ouyang et al. ShinyCell: Simple and sharable visualisation of single-cell gene expression data. Bioinformatics, doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btab209](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab209) for creating interactive Shiny-based web applications to visualize single-cell RNA-seq data. ShinyCell is designed to use single cell dataset objects (such as h5ad, loom, Seurat, SingleCellExperiment). In this repository we are sharing required instructions/scripts to make it compatible with DBiT-seq data.

# How to run 
As explained [here](https://github.com/SGDDNB/ShinyCell#quick-start-guide), to run the app locally, first make a folder with the favorite name and copy all of the shared files (that include .rds, .h5 and .txt files) plus two important .R files server.R and ui.R (that can be found also [here](https://github.com/atlasxomics/ShinyCell/tree/main/R)) into the new created folder as shown below.

Next, browse to the Rstudio working directory and change it to the new created folder as shown below in "R Sessions" section.

Then open either server.R or ui.R using RStudio and click on "Run App" in the top right corner. Now, you are all set to explore the data!

# Required Libraries
make sure the following librarires already installed on Rstudio: Since all of them are CRAN packages use this code to install them simply:

install.packages(c("shiny", "shinyhelper", "data.table", "Matrix", "DT", "magrittr","ggplot2","ggrepel","hdf5r","ggdendro","gridExtra", "ggseqlogo", "circlize"))

make sure to restart RStudio after installing the new packages.





# Quick Start Guide
Please check [here](https://github.com/SGDDNB/ShinyCell#quick-start-guide) for a quick guide. The main differences between the original version and the version here is the ability of visualize two different samples side by side.
The current version contains eleven function tabs, and more functions might be added in the near future.
