# Introduction
ShinyCell is a R package generated by [Ouyang et al. ShinyCell: Simple and sharable visualisation of single-cell gene expression data. Bioinformatics, doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btab209](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab209) that allows users to create interactive Shiny-based web applications to visualise single-cell data. Since ShinyCell designed for using singlecell dataset objects (such as h5ad, loom, Seurat,SingleCellExperiment) thus, in this repository we share required files to make it compatible with Debit-seq and spatial maps.
# How to run 
as [here](https://github.com/SGDDNB/ShinyCell#quick-start-guide) explains, to run the app locally, first make a folder with the favorite name and put all of the shared files (that include .rds, .h5 and .txt files) plus two important .R files server.R or ui.R. Then open either server.R or ui.R using RStudio the new created shiny app folder and click on "Run App" in the top right corner. Now, you are all set to explore your data!
